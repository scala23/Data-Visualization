I wanted my data visualzation to show something that was interesting and easy to interperate. I also wanted it to show data in a way that you can draw conclusions about the data. I also wanted a bigger picture to be shown. I chose the flight csv file that I found online because I thought I could do something interesitng with the data. Using longititude and latitude to map points was new to me and I saw someone do it online. Once I had done it though it was very easy. One thing I ended up struggling with was the conditional for the points. I fixed this when I figured out what to put in the first part of the conditional. I learned a lot about how to use csv files and how they can be used to visualize data.
